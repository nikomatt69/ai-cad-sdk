# Model Context Protocol System

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) system is a powerful framework for integrating AI capabilities into your applications. This guide will help you understand the core concepts and get started quickly.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standardized protocol for interacting with AI models in a consistent way across different providers and platforms. It provides:

- Unified interface for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- Built-in caching and optimization
- Type-safe interactions
- React hooks and components
- Extensible architecture

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { createMCPClient } from '@ai-cad-sdk/core';

const client = createMCPClient({
  provider: 'openai',
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
});

// Make AI requests
const response = await client.complete({
  prompt: 'Generate a 3D model of...',
  maxTokens: 1000
});
```

## Core Concepts

### Providers

MCP supports multiple AI providers out of the box:

- OpenAI (GPT-3, GPT-4, DALL-E)
- Anthropic Claude
- Custom providers via adapters

### Caching

Built-in semantic caching reduces API costs and improves response times:

```typescript
const client = createMCPClient({
  cache: {
    type: 'semantic',
    similarity: 0.85
  }
});
```

### Type Safety

Full TypeScript support with:

- Request/response typing
- Model-specific parameters
- Runtime type validation
