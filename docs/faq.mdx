# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is AI CAD SDK?
AI CAD SDK is a comprehensive toolkit for integrating AI capabilities into CAD and design applications. It provides a unified interface for working with various AI models and providers.

### Which AI providers are supported?
We currently support:
- OpenAI (GPT-3, GPT-4, DALL-E)
- Anthropic Claude
- Custom providers via adapters

### Is it production-ready?
Yes! The SDK is built with production use cases in mind, featuring:
- Type safety
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Caching
- Performance optimizations

## Technical Questions

### How do I handle API keys securely?
Never expose API keys in your frontend code. Instead:
- Use environment variables
- Implement a backend proxy
- Use secure vaults for key storage

```typescript
// DO NOT
const client = createMCPClient({
  apiKey: 'sk-...' // ❌ Never hardcode
});

// DO
const client = createMCPClient({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY // ✅ Use env vars
});
```

### How does caching work?
The SDK includes semantic caching that:
- Reduces API costs
- Improves response times
- Handles similar prompts
- Is configurable per use case

### Can I use custom models?
Yes! You can:
1. Create a custom adapter
2. Implement the provider interface
3. Register your adapter with the SDK

## Performance

### How do I optimize response times?
Several strategies are available:
- Use semantic caching
- Implement request batching
- Configure timeout settings
- Use streaming for long responses

### What about rate limiting?
The SDK handles rate limiting by:
- Respecting provider limits
- Implementing exponential backoff
- Providing queue management
- Offering retry strategies

## Troubleshooting

### Common Error Messages

#### "Provider not found"
```typescript
// Solution: Ensure provider is properly imported and registered
import { OpenAIAdapter } from '@ai-cad-sdk/adapters';
client.registerProvider('openai', new OpenAIAdapter());
```

#### "Invalid API key"
- Check environment variables
- Verify API key format
- Ensure key has required permissions
